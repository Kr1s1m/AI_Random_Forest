# Random Forest
## Artificial Intelligence

This is a Random Forest C++ library made from scratch by me, Kristian Simov, as a project for university course Design of Algorithms (part 2 - advanced).
The topic that I chose is Artificial Intelligence and the selected algorithm is Random Forest.

There is a google slides presentation, in the format of an AI algorithms lecture, which accompanies this project.
The slides are in Bulgarian and you can find them here:
